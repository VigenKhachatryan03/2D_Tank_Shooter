# 2D Tank Shooter Game

Welcome to the 2D Tank Shooter Game! This Unity project is aimed at learning about collision detection, physics, and working with coordinates through a fun and challenging experience.

## Description

In this game, the player controls a tank that continuously fires while enemy tanks spawn from the top and move downwards. The goal is to destroy the enemy tanks before they reach the bottom. The game features increasing difficulty as more enemy tanks appear over time.

## Features

- **Automatic Firing**: The player's tank automatically fires projectiles.
- **Enemy Spawning**: Enemies continuously spawn from the top and move towards the bottom of the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: Shooting and destroying enemies involves Unity's collision system.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: More enemy tanks spawn as the game progresses, making it more challenging.

## Getting Started

1. Open in Unity (version 2021.3.27f1 LTS or later).
2. Press play to run.

## How to Play

- Control your tank and destroy as many enemy tanks as possible.
- The tank fires automaticallyâ€”just focus on aiming and avoiding the enemies.
- Try to survive as long as possible as the difficulty increases over time.
